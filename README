If you are building Zyzzyva from source code, you will need the Qt4 library,
available from http://www.trolltech.com/download/opensource.html.

After Qt4 is installed, the following steps should be sufficient to
build Zyzzyva:

    qmake
    make

On Mac OS X, instead of running qmake and make directly, you should run
installer/create-macx-bundle.sh instead.  This will create an executable
bundle under installer/macosx.

Please email Michael Thelen with questions, comments, patches, or large cash
donations.  Happy hacking!
