If you are building Zyzzyva from source code, you will need the Qt5 library,
available from https://www.qt.io/download-open-source

After Qt5 is installed, the following steps should be sufficient to
build Zyzzyva:

    qmake
    make

On Mac OS X, instead of running qmake and make directly, you should run
installer/create-macx-bundle.sh instead.  This will create an executable
bundle under installer/macosx.
